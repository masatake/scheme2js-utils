scheme2js-utils is a collection of commands helping scheme2js scripting.
lscheme2js and ischeme2js are included.

* lscheme2js 

  This lists all available scheme symbols defined in scheme2js runtime.
  Currently gauche is required. This should be replaced with scheme2js 
  itself.

    $ lscheme2js | tail
    with-output-to-procedure ; runtime.js
    with-output-to-procedure ; runtime_callcc.js
    with-output-to-procedure ; runtime_interface_callcc.js
    with-output-to-string ; runtime.js
    with-output-to-string ; runtime_callcc.js
    with-output-to-string ; runtime_interface_callcc.js
    write ; runtime.js
    write-char ; runtime.js
    write-circle ; runtime.js
    zero? ; runtime.js


* ischeme2js

  This runs scheme2js as if it is interpreter.
  It invoke scheme2js compiler to compile a given scheme script into a js script
  then invokes rhino js interpreter to run the js script.
  ischeme2js is command line tool, no web browser is needed: stdio are established
  internally.

    $ cat a.scm
    (display (cons 'x (read)))(newline)
    (display (cons 'y (read)))(newline)
    (display (cons 'z (read)))(newline)
    $ cat input
    (a)
    (b)
    (c)
    $ ischeme2js a.scm < input
    (x a)
    (y b)
    (z c)
